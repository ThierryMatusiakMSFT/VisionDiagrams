# Priva

Microsoft Priva fulfills data subject requests and monitors personal data.

## Context
Priva is made of 2 modules.  
1. Administrators manage Data Subjet Requests (DSR). Priva identifies and extracts relevant data in M365.  
2. Administrators define privacy policies. They monitor M365 activity and content to raise alerts and notify users.

## More details
Priva Admins rely on Teams to collaborate and PowerAutomate to launch complementary actions.  
Policies are scoped with sensitive information types, users and locations.  
Case Investigators can analyze M365 content to better understand an open issue.  
Priva also provides a Graph API to integrate with third-party solutions.
