# Data Lifecycle Management & Records Management

Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) protects important data during its retention period. 
It can also erase old data. 

Records Management extends DLM to prevent records updates or deletion.

## Context
Compliance Officers define a set of Retention Labels and Retention Policies.  
These policies result into data retention during the specified period (if a user deletes this content).  
They can also result into data deletion after a specific period. This deletion can be automatic or request a dispotion review.  
Both Records Management and Data Lifecycle Management manager M365 Data.  
M365 uses dedicated storage locations to preserve data.
