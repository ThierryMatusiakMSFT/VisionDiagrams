# Data Lifecycle Management & Records Management

Data Lifecycle Management (DLM) protects important data during its retention period. 
It can also erase old data. 

Records Management extends DLM to prevent records updates or deletion.

## Context
Compliance Officers define a set of Retention Labels and Retention Policies.  
These policies result into data retention during the specified period (in case a user deletes this content).  
They can also result into data deletion after a specific period. This deletion can be automatic or go through a disposition review.  
Both Records Management and Data Lifecycle Management apply to M365 Data.  
M365 uses dedicated storage locations to preserve data.

## 3 complementary options exist to apply rules:    
1. Define and publish Retention Labels, so that Business Users can apply these Retention Labels.  
2. Define Retention Labels, then define a Policy to automatically apply these Labels to the appropriate content.  
3. Define a transparent Retention Policy (without a Label) and automatically apply these rules to the appropriate content.

## Labels - Summary
A File Plan consists in a set of Labels.  
Every Label may include a disposition reivew step before data gets deleted.  
The Labels are applied to resources (containers and content).  
3 flavors of Labels exist:  
- "Standard" Retention Labels define a retention period and/or the need to delete the data after it expires
- Records prevent updates during the retention period
- Regulatory Record cannot be removed once they have been applied
